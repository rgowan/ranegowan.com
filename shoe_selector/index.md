#### Description

In my final project we were given full autonomy to decide the idea and tech, I found the experience of shopping online for trainers quite outdated, 
So I created a mobile first app, which emulates tinder but introduces shopping for trainers, 
Allowing the user to show all the trainers they have liked giving them the name, price and a link to buy for each individual product.
