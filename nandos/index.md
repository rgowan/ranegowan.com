#### Description

A simple app which gave the user a series of questions on how their day was going to determine what sauce they should get with their 
Nandos based on their answers. 
Worked in a group of 2. 
As we only had 24 hours to complete our project, we decided to stick to each otherâ€™s strengths, as it would be most productive. My colleague crated the logic of the questionnaire in the backend and i worked on the front end, designing and styling the project.
