                Hey, my name is Rane and I'm a software engineer based in London
                with over 8 years experience in the industry. I started my
                journey by doing a 12 week web development immersive course at
                General Assembly, a course I later went on to teach. Now, I am a
                consultant at Red Badger where I have worked with company's such
                as Fortnum & Mason, Nando's and Levi's to deliver new innovative
                digital products using a variety of languages, frameworks and
                processes. Check out my CV for more details!

                  Rane has hit the ground running on the Assortify project. He
                  quickly orientated himself within a complex area of the
                  codebase and has been delivering sterling work. He's taken
                  ownership of his assigned tickets, asking for support where
                  needed and coordinated with the team to deliver them as
                  planned at a high level of quality. He always gives very clear
                  reports on progress and highlights potential issues early
                  which is great. Super impressed with Rane's work and
                  appreciate his upbeat attitude and Dad jokes, keep them
                  coming!

                  Rane has a broad range of strong skills, both within
                  boundaries of his current role and without. He's good at
                  appreciating the responsibilities & motivations of all the
                  different types of roles he works with (both Badger-side and
                  client-side), making him a great collaborative member of the
                  team. He easily takes part in broader conversations relating
                  to the wider project and has a rare skill for clearly
                  explaining what could otherwise be a confusingly technical
                  points -- a bonus when part of his job is working with more
                  junior members of the team and non-developers. He's always
                  happy to sit down and "work the problem" with me while on his
                  tickets and challenge the designs where necessary, which I
                  appreciate -- I definitely feel that it contributes to Rane
                  producing high quality work that reflects the needs of our
                  end-users and clients alike.

                  Rane is one of the best teachers and mentors that I have had
                  the pleasure of learning from. He has the ability to teach
                  complex technical solutions and techniques in a non-technical
                  way which is a skill that I don't believe even some of the
                  professors at University possessed. Rane is a natural- his
                  aptitude for teaching and coding are unrivalled and I wouldn't
                  hesitate to recommend Rane! I sincerely hope to work with Rane
                  again in the future. I can imagine Rane being a very
                  successful CTO one day (watch this space)

                  From the moment he joined GA, I was impressed by how smart,
                  dedicated and hardworking Rane was. As a Lead Web Development
                  Instructor at General Assembly, Rane cared deeply about the
                  success of his students, and constantly went above and beyond
                  to support them and pass on his extensive coding knowledge. As
                  such, he did a wonderful job preparing the next generation of
                  coders and web developers for a new career in the industry. I
                  would absolutely recommend Rane to any team out there, and
                  won't hesitate to work with him again in the future!
