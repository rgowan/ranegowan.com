          <p>I have worked with Rane now for two and a half years. In that time I have seen him develop not only as a coder but also as an instructor. His exacting standards and high expectations of himself mean that he is always growing and improving. I am sad to no longer be working with him, but am excited to see him progress in the tech sector, and hope that we will work together again in the future.</p>

          <h3>Web Development Immersive Lead Instructor</h3>

          </p>
          <article>
            <p>After spending 3 courses as a co-instructor, I had gained a lot of experience technically and understood the process on how to manage and maintain the course from start to finish. For this reason, I was offered the role of Lead Instructor.</p>

            <p>In this role. I would be teaching 80% of the lessons during the course. I would also be managing the instructional team ensuring that everyone was happy, aware of what was expected of them and most importantly challenged and engaged throughout the course. I also made some key decisions and changes to the global curriculum with the local lead instructor team. However, I also had the sole responsibility for updates and new lessons, such as the integration of Foodie, the main React curriculum resource. I really enjoyed this aspect of the job as it allowed me to learn new things outside of the curriculum and then integrate it into what I was teaching.</p>

            <p>It was at this time when the course would pivot once more, further increasing the amount of Javascript, this time introducing React which resulted in having to strip Ruby out altogether. This resulted in many meetings with other lead instructors both in-house and offshore discussing how and what should be covered and writing lessons on those topics. This enabled me to test myself technically completely outside of the curriculum to learn a brand new framework and help contribute to the curriculum that I would be on of the first to teach.</p>

          </p>
          <article>
            <p>During my time in my second course as a teaching assistant, I took a great interest in teaching more. It was with this that I moved into an instructor role, this allowed me to work a lot closer with the lead instructor of the class giving me more of an input on how the class was running and suggesting things we could change to better the experience for both instructors and students. Along with this, I was teaching one or two classes a day. This was a great learning experience as I had to ensure that I was fully prepared for each lesson, making sure that I had a full understanding of the topic, which I could explain thoroughly during the lesson and be able to answer any potential questions that students may have had.</p>

            <p>I was also responsible for having 1 on 1 catch up’s with the students every module to discuss their progress. This was a more formal conversation and I would provide feedback on the projects they have completed which usually consisted of going through the code that they had written and offering ways they could improve. Depending on the amount of staff that were issued per class.</p>

            <p>There were many times where I also had to take the responsibility of a teaching assistant as well as that of an Instructor. This was very challenging at times but allowed me to develop the skill to prioritse my workload more effectively and be flexible when timetables or daily plans had to change last minute. </p>

          <h3>Web Development Immersive Teaching Assistant</h3>

          </p>
          <article>
            <p>Upon finishing the course, I was offered the job to be a teaching assistant for the upcoming course. It was at this time when the curriculum would shift into focusing more on JavaScript, with an emphasis on Node, Express, ES6 and Angular. I was responsible for reviewing all the students work that they had to complete out of hours and providing constructive feedback on how they could improve. This would have to be documented and brought forward in weekly meetings to discuss the progression of students with the instructors, producers and outcomes managers.</p>

            <p> I also was in charge of all morning homework reviews which would consist of students coming to the front of the class and presenting their homework from the night before. During this exercise, I would help with bug fixing or be coaching them on problems they had during the task, whilst asking questions on their approach. I also took charge in introducing and running the independent exercises that were given to students during the day, ensuring I was always there to help out or assist. Which followed with a review once the exercise had been completed. </p>

            <p>Possibly the most challenging aspect of the role was the project time where students had a week to build a project for their portfolios. These were far more complex and it was important that I kept track of every student's progress and was on hand to help whenever needed. This was done by talking through the problem and discussing ways they could approach it to overcome the error or bug. Occasionally pair programming with students if needed.</p>

            <p>After the course had finished, I was approached to continue in this role as they were impressed with how I had performed. It was in this course where I expressed interest in taking a couple of lessons during the week and increasing the amount of responsibility that I had, which I enjoyed. </p>

          <h3>Web Development Immersive Student</h3>
          <p class="banner">
            <span>General Assemblty</span>
          </p>

          <article>
            <p>The Web Development Immersive full-time course at General Assembly was my very first introduction to coding, development and problem-solving. It really tested me both mentally and physically but I knew from the first couple of weeks that this was what I wanted to do as I enjoyed constant process never feeling like there wasn’t something new to learn or get better at.</p>

            <p>The course consisted of 4 modules, the first, covering very basic Ruby logic and syntax along with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The second, focusing on backend frameworks Sinatra and Ruby on Rails. In the third module, we covered consuming 3rd party API’s using AJAX followed by the final module where we looked at a front-end framework called Backbone.js. Along the way, we also covered user authentication, image upload and testing.</p>

            <p>During this time, I created three projects, two individual projects and one in a small team of three, each project was a week long and allowed us to consolidate and practice the content we had covered during the module. These projects were my most enjoyable part of the course as it allowed me to test myself to ensure I understood every topic that was covered and in some cases go beyond and implement things completely on my own. Overall, it was a great exercise to get an understanding of how I would be working in the industry day to day.</p>
