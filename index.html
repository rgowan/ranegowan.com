His exacting standards and high expectations of himself mean that he is always growing and improving. I am sad to no longer be working with him, but am excited to see him progress in the tech sector, and hope that we will work together again in the future.</p>

              <p>As a Lead Instructor, I was liable for preparation, leadership and delivery of the web development curriculum. I was also responsible for the day-to-day team management of teaching assistants ensuring that everyone had a clear understanding of the teaching tasks, what was expected of them and most importantly that they are supported, challenged and engaged throughout the course.</p>

              <p>I also made some key decisions and changes to the curriculum including updates and creation of the new React material, which resulted in much improved and understandable module for the students. I really enjoyed this aspect of the job as it allowed me to learn new content outside of the curriculum and then integrate it into what I was teaching. I have written about 15%-20% of the current local curriculum.</p>

              <p>In this role, I worked much closer with the lead instructor of the class giving me more of an input on how the class was running and suggesting things we could change to better the experience for both instructors and students. Along with this, I was teaching one or two classes a day.</p>

              <p>I was also would hold formal 1:1 catch up’s with the students on completion of every module to discuss their progress, provide feedback on the code they have written for their projects and providing advice on improvement areas.</p>
              
              <p>I was regularly asked to step in and act as Lead Instructor due to illness or needing to take some time off. This was very challenging at times but allowed me to expand the level of my responsibility.</p>

            <p>I was responsible for assisting the instructor with the running of the course, mainly helping on the student side. Daily, I reviewed all the students' work that was completed out of hours and provided constructive feedback. I ran homework reviews and independent exercises every morning in front of the class, where students would present their work. It was my responsibility to help them with bug fixing, answer any potential questions the class had and help them to break down these problems, whilst checking for that everyone was following.</p>

Focusing on the core values and principles of the Agile mindset and how these are implemented into the framework Scrum. And a popular lean method of management called Kanban.

          </p>

          <article>
            <p>This full-time course was my introduction to web development. The course consisted of 4 modules, firstly covering the basics of Ruby, HTML and CSS. Followed by focusing on the frameworks Ruby on Rails and Sinatra. Next, looking at 3rd party APIs and AJAX. And finally, the front-end framework Backbonejs. Along the way, we also covered user authentication, image upload and testing.</p>

            <p>During this time, I created three projects, two individual projects and one in a small team of three, each project was a week long and allowed us to consolidate and practice the content we had covered during the module. These projects were my most enjoyable part of the course as it allowed me to test myself to ensure I understood every topic that was covered and in some cases go beyond and implement things completely on my own. Overall, it was a great exercise to get an understanding of how I would be working in the industry day to day.</p>
