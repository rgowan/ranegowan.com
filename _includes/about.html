          <p class="about-me">Hi, I’m Rane. From young age I have been introduced to various different types of tech  during the boom of the industry through both my parents work. I’ve always had the goal of basing my career in this industry. After working in retail for a while, I realised that now is the time to make my goal a reality. I came across General Assembly and was instantly drawn to the Web Development Immersive (WDI) course. Starting the course was one of the best decisions I have made. I enjoyed every second of the course learning, creating and socialising and I have developed a skill set which I hope to build on in the coming years working in a team as a web developer. Throughout the course I was equally comfortable with both front and back end development but I was particularly drawn to front end because of my natural appreciation for good design and my keen attention to detail. Not only have I developed skills in coding, but I have also developed a strong problem solving mind set as this is crucial to being a good web developer.</p>
